=================== alpine: upgrade package ===============================================

		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49118579/alpine-dockerfile-advantages-of-no-cache-vs-rm-var-cache-apk
		The --no-cache option allows to not cache the index locally, which is useful for keeping containers small.
		Literally it equals apk update in the beginning and rm -rf /var/cache/apk/* in the end.

   apk --update
   	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43681432/explanation-of-the-update-add-command-for-alpine-linux
   	it is similar to the Debian apt-get update that you do before apt-get install my_package

   	Update the Package list
			Remote repositories change as packages are added and upgraded. To get the latest list of available packages, use the update command. The command downloads the APKINDEX.tar.gz from each repository and stores it in the local cache, typically /var/cache/apk/, /var/lib/apk/ or /etc/apk/cache/.

		apk update
			Tip: If using remote repositories, it is a good idea to do an update just before doing an add or upgrade command. That way you know you are using the latest software available.
