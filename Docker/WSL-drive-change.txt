  			- Check volume path
  			- You can find WSL2 volumes under a hidden network share. Open Windows Explorer, and type \\wsl$ into the location bar. Hit enter, and it should display your WSL volumes, including the ones for Docker for Windows.


------------ Drive Path change steps -----------------


The WSL 2 docker-desktop-data vm disk image would normally reside in: %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Docker\wsl\data\ext4.vhdx

Follow the following to relocate it to other drive/directory, with all existing docker data preserved (tested against Docker Desktop 2.3.0.4 (46911), and continued to work after updating the 3.1.0 (51484)):

1. First, shut down your docker desktop by right click on the Docker Desktop icon and select Quit Docker Desktop
	wsl --shutdown
	
2. Then, open your command prompt:

	wsl --list -v
	You should be able to see, make sure the STATE for both is Stopped.(wsl  --shutdown)

	  NAME                   STATE           VERSION
	* docker-desktop         Stopped         2
	  docker-desktop-data    Stopped         2

3. Export docker-desktop-data into a file

	wsl --export docker-desktop-data "D:\Docker\wsl\data\docker-desktop-data.tar"

4. Unregister docker-desktop-data from wsl, note that after this, your ext4.vhdx file would automatically be removed (so back it up first if you have important existing image/container):

	wsl --unregister docker-desktop-data

5. Import the docker-desktop-data back to wsl, but now the ext4.vhdx would reside in different drive/directory:

	wsl --import docker-desktop-data "D:\Docker\wsl\data" "D:\Docker\wsl\data\docker-desktop-data.tar" --version 2
	
	Start the Docker Desktop again and it should work

6. You may delete the D:\Docker\wsl\data\docker-desktop-data.tar file (NOT the ext4.vhdx file) if everything looks good for you after verifying
